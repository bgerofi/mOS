.SH NAME
lwkreset \- Terminate all Light Weight Kernel (LWK) processes and initialize the LWK environment. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lwkreset [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBlwkreset\fP is a mechanism for terminating Light Weight Kernel (LWK)
processes and initializing LWK environment within a node. If the caller is authorized
to only a subset of the processes, then that subset of processes will be terminated and no
error indication will be surfaced. This mechanism should be used for terminating 
processes within a node when termination through the \fByod\fP launch path is not possible or practical. 

.SH OPTIONS

.PP


.TP
.B --verbose, -v <\fInumber\fP>
Controls the verbosity of \fBlwkreset\fP.  \fINumber\fP is an integer between 0
and 9.  Note that the argument is required.

.TP
.B --help, -h
Prints a terse version of this documentation.


.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
.B lwkreset
The LWK processes will be terminated and the LWK environment will be initialized.


.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.PP
.B LWKRESET_VERBOSE 
may be used to control the verbosity.  Specifying
\fB--verbose=\fP on the command line takes precedence over this environment
variable.
